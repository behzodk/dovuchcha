imagine having to split a city into two  completely separate parts.
roads that  used to connect are now dead ends your  job on the other side of the city  inaccessible and the neighbor across the  street that you used to see daily you  will perhaps never speak to him again  the Berlin Wall did exactly that  separating East and West for almost 30  years for this video I've animated the  various development stages of the wall  in order to understand the design of  this unique piece of art architecture  this is how the Berlin Wall  [Music]  worked living in Berlin before the wall  was built was a strange life you could  move around the entire city freely but  you were either an East Berliner or a  West  Berliner after the second world war the  Victorious Nations had divided the  German City into several parts the  Soviet occupation Zone ultimately became  the territory of East Germany a  socialist State and the West western  part of Berlin remained legally occupied  but in all practicality it belonged to  West Germany a capitalist  State socialism and capitalism two  different nations and even two different  currencies separated only by  streets trains connecting the different  parts of the city would make  announcements next station last stop in  the Eastern Zone many people lived in  one part of the city but worked in the  other East Berlin blers took jobs in the  West in order to benefit from the  stronger currency while West berliners  got their haircuts in the east at prices  that were much cheaper to them and in a  way both systems tried to outdo the  other in West Berlin a multitude of  stores sprang up on the core first and  dum Street shop Windows filled with the  latest brandname products of Western  consumer culture while just a few  streets away in East Berlin there was  Stalin Ali A Street that was transformed  into a Boulevard full of buildings in  the style of socialist  classicism but this open coexistence of  two systems wouldn't last  long on the 13th of August 1961 Berlin  woke up to a divided City the East  German government closed the border  which means that families were split  apart though officially stating that  this was necessary to protect their  country it was an effort to stop their  own City citizens from fleeing to the  west where opportunities wages and  freedoms seemed greater at the start  this was just a wall in name it mostly  consisted of fences and loose pieces of  bobbed wire manned by guards there were  some unguarded stretches and it was even  possible to jump  across to make escaping more difficult  construction immediately began on a more  permanent wall made out of concrete and  topped off with with bobbed wire coil  around a r-shaped metal arm but this is  not how the wall looked everywhere a  shortage of building materials meant  that in the first years just 10% of the  Border was built like this and there was  another issue sometimes the border  between West and East Berlin went  straight through housing blocks houses  that now had to become part of the wall  the East German authorities forced  people out of their homes and filled the  window windows with  braks sometimes however they would  forget a  window on August 17 1962 Peter fer  discovers one such house making up part  of the wall Peter is frustrated with the  East German government as they won't let  him see his sister that lives on the  other side of the wall together with his  colleague Helmut he fantasizes about an  escape to the West the two of them see  people inside the house in order not to  be noticed they take off their shoes and  quietly creep in by sheer luck they  quickly find the open window and from  here they have a clear view of the road  to Freedom a fence then a clear strip  and finally a  wall it seems doable except for the fact  that they are in plain side of the  nearby border guards suddenly they hear  voices behind them  and it is now or  never Peter and Helmut jump out of the  window and climb the First Fence then  they are  spotted and immediately the guards open  fire Helmut dashes across the strip  through a haze of bullets as he scales  the wall he looks back and he sees his  friend Peter Frozen in place the guards  are closing in fervor and they will have  a clear shot soon hmut screams and Peter  finally Springs into action he makes it  across the strip but as he jumps up to  scale the wall he is hit midair and  slumps down Helmut can't help his friend  an entire 50 minutes passes as a crowd  of onlookers gathers to see Peter lying  on the ground slowly dying at the base  of the  wall  tragic stories like Peter fers were  widely covered in the west but for the  East German authorities the only Lesson  Learned was to increase the  wall over the course of decades the wall  is consistently upgraded with more and  more increasing security  features what once was a single wall  soon became a brutal Border strip  cutting the city further and further  apart as improvements to the wall were  made Escape attempts shifted to new  methods and the wall would be expanded  again a back and fourth that was  repeated until the last version of the  wall was built the version of the wall  that became famous from 1975 on the East  German authorities rolled out this  version of the wall a border virtually  impossible for anyone to  cross and this is how it generally works  marked coming from the East only the  visual barrier made of concrete slabs  can be seen this was done so that the  exact border fortifications are not  visible as this knowledge could be used  to plan Escape  attempts just behind this barrier the  ground is covered in so-called Stalin's  grass these are mats made of steel  needles that would pierce the foot of  anyone trying to jump  across next up is a signal fence  consisting of bed wire stretched over  concrete posts anyone trying to scale  this fence would quickly press the wires  together triggering an alarm and  notifying the guards in a nearby  Watchtower watchtowers were manned 24/7  by two to five  soldiers these soldiers had a clear view  of the whole border with orders to shoot  anyone on  site trying to use brute force to break  these sections would not work either as  behind the signal fence are several rows  of tank traps bearing anyone from  driving through with a  vehicle in the middle of this border  zone is a path for soldiers to patrol  the area often times accompanied by  dogs and behind this is the so-called  death strip a stroke of dirt stretching  for miles in every direction in full  sight of the guard  towers hiding is impossible and if  anyone somehow made it past here they  reach a part that is easily recognizable  the wall facing the western side in  contrast to the old wall these elements  had a foot-shaped bottom which meant  that no holes in the ground were needed  for their Construction and instead of  bobbed wire on top there were now pipes  made of asbestos concrete these pipes  provided stability for the wall elements  and the East German authorities also  hoped that they would decrease the  prison camp feeling of the previous wall  but this was not the only reason for the  change the new concrete used was  extremely smooth with nothing to grasp  onto one thing the authorities didn't  consider however is that this smoothness  made the wall an easy target for  graffiti from the western side graffiti  that would dominate many of the 45,000  elements that were placed in Berlin  artworks that would often mock the East  German government resulted in an open  gallery of sorts highlighting the harsh  difference between life in the west  where free artistic expression was  possible and life in the East where this  was  Unthinkable exact numbers of victims  from this wall are disputed and it is  something that to this day is being  researched but over the years it was  many who just like Peter fer were hoping  for a better life on the other side of  the  [Music]  wall but the Berlin Wall was only a  small part of the division of Germany in  addition to Berlin the whole country was  also divided into to two parts and some  people made daring attempts risking  their lives to try to get to freedom for  example the two friends G vetel and  Peter strelzik who wanted to build a  better life for themselves in the west  and after coming across an article about  hot air balloons an insane plan was born  the two decided to build their own  homemade hot air balloon to escape  across the  border after everything is sewn together  the burner is started and the balloon  takes off  but then immediately after taking off a  huge hole is torn in the top of the  balloon and they could crash to the  ground from over 6,000  ft I made a complete video about the  spectacular balloon escape with some of  my most elaborate animations and  illustrations and I was able to  interview Gunter for his project who  told me how the daring escape attempt  went trying  to this documentary is part of my  ongoing nebula original series under  exposure in which I create higher budget  Productions such as my video about the  bin Laden rate with detailed animations  exploring how the rate unfolded or my  video about the tenar disaster the worst  aviation accident that ever happened  videos that are not made for the YouTube  algorithm but unrushed storytelling  nebula is a creator-owned streaming  service where the likes of Johnny Harris  W over Productions real life lore or the  present past post their videos early at  free and create higher budget  Originals the present past actually  wrote the script for this very video  with me and he has his own fantastic  video out about all the different  borders in the world which I would  highly recommend checking out so go to  [Music]  40% off on an
