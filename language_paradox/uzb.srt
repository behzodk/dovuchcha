00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:08,760
Just over a decade ago, the last native speaker 
of Yurok died. And the language – which had been  

2
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:13,840
spoken by indigenous people in California for 
more than 10,000 years – died with him. And  

3
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:19,440
Yurok isn’t alone; every year, an estimated 
nine languages go extinct. That’s why,  

4
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:23,560
if you look at an official count of the total 
number of living languages in the world over time,  

5
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:28,240
you can see that … wait, huh? 
How are we gaining languages?

6
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,800
Hi, I’m David, and this is MinuteEarth.

7
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,400
First off, even though some languages are 
going extinct, others that have been around  

8
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:39,040
for a long time – like Lakurumau, spoken 
by a small group of villagers in Papua New  

9
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:43,080
Guinea – are only just being described by 
experts, and so they’re only now getting  

10
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:46,360
added to the official count. You know how 
there are species that have been around  

11
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:50,240
for ages – like the shrew-like animal called 
a gymnure, which has been shrewing around in  

12
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:53,360
the mountains of the Philippines for hundreds 
of thousands of years – but they’re only just  

13
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,880
being photographed and documented for 
the first time? It’s a lot like that.

14
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:01,040
But by far the biggest reason for the increase 
in living languages is the realization that what  

15
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:05,519
we once thought was one language is actually 
a group of similar but distinct languages.

16
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,960
Like, until the early 2000s, most experts 
considered Arabic – spoken by more than a  

17
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:13,600
billion people – a single language. But 
as linguists learned more about all the  

18
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,120
different versions of Arabic, they realized 
that some versions were so different that  

19
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:20,520
people speaking them couldn’t even 
understand each other. As a result,  

20
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:25,000
what used to be one language is now 
officially more than 30 different languages.

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,440
Actually, that TOO is a lot like what’s going 
on with species on Earth; like, for a long time,  

22
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:32,960
scientists considered giraffes to be 
a single species. But recent genetic  

23
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,760
research has revealed that there are actually 
four separately-evolving groups of giraffes,  

24
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:40,880
prompting a proposal to quadruple the 
official number of giraffe species out there.

25
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,640
So the number of known languages currently 
spoken on Earth and the number of described  

26
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,680
species currently living on Earth are both 
officially increasing, but only because we're  

27
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:52,960
getting better – and pickier – about documenting 
and categorizing what’s out there, not because  

28
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:58,000
we’re actually gaining diversity. I mean, 
sure – new species and new languages ARE still  

29
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,640
occasionally evolving, but that’s a really slow 
process; as our planet globalizes and homogenizes,  

30
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:08,600
existing species and languages are going 
extinct way faster than new ones are evolving.

31
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:12,400
Soon, it’s likely that we’ll reach peak 
language and peak species – that is,  

32
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,360
we'll have documented and nit-picked basically 
all we can, yet we’ll be losing languages and  

33
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:21,160
species faster than ever – so the official counts 
will begin to reflect the reality on the ground.

34
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:26,200
Which is…depressing. Occasionally, though, we 
might be able to raise a language or species from  

35
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:30,920
the dead. We’re still working on figuring out how 
to clone dinosaurs, but Yurok – that indigenous  

36
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:36,040
language that died in 2013 – is alive again; it’s 
actively being taught in some high schools, and  

37
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:40,680
today, more than 300 kids speak it proficiently. 
So despite all the linguistic and biological  

38
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:47,720
diversity we’re losing, perhaps – every once in 
a while – life – and language – will find a way.

39
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:52,000
To understand and play with data, like the number 
of languages or species in the world - or anything  

40
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,240
else you’re interested in - you need to practice, 
and Brilliant is where you learn by doing,  

41
00:02:56,240 --> 00:03:00,600
with thousands of interactive lessons 
in data analysis, math, programming,  

42
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:05,160
and AI. Brilliant helps you build real skills 
through hands-on problem-solving based on lessons  

43
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:09,760
created by MIT and CalTech professors and it 
recently launched a ton of new data courses,  

44
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:14,240
all of which use real-world data to train you to 
see trends and make better-informed decisions.  

45
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:17,440
I’m currently making my way through their 
new course on exploring data visually, where  

46
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:22,000
I’m playing with real data sets from sources like 
Starbucks and AirBnB. To try everything Brilliant  

47
