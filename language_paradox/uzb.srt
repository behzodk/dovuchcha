1
00:00:03,159 --> 00:00:05,480
just over a decade ago the last native

2
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:08,360
speaker of yoro died and the language

3
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:09,840
which had been spoken by indigenous

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,280
people in California for more than

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,480
10,000 years died with him and yorck

6
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,199
isn't alone every year an estimated nine

7
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:19,640
languages go extinct that's why if you

8
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:21,359
look at an official count of the total

9
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:22,920
number of living languages in the world

10
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:26,039
over time you can see that wait huh how

11
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:29,359
are we gaining languages hi I'm David

12
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:31,599
and this is minute Earth first off even

13
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:33,520
though some languages are going extinct

14
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:34,960
others that have been around for a long

15
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,840
time like lumu spoken by a small group

16
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,079
of villagers in Papua New guini are only

17
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,120
just being described by experts and so

18
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,600
they're only now getting added to the

19
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,320
official count you know how there are

20
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:47,199
species that have been around for ages

21
00:00:47,199 --> 00:00:48,600
like the Shrew likee animal called a

22
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,239
jimmere which has been shwing around in

23
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:51,399
the mountains of the Philippines for

24
00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:52,760
hundreds of thousands of years but

25
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,239
they're only just being photographed and

26
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:56,079
documented for the first time it's a lot

27
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:58,120
like that but by far the biggest reason

28
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:00,120
for the increase in living languages is

29
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,399
the realization that what we once

30
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:03,160
thought was one language is actually a

31
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:05,519
group of similar but distinct languages

32
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,040
like until the early 2000s most experts

33
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,960
considered Arabic spoken by more than a

34
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,240
billion people a single language but as

35
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,600
linguists learn more about all the

36
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,119
different versions of Arabic they

37
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:16,560
realized that some versions were so

38
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,880
different that the people speaking them

39
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,880
couldn't even understand each other as a

40
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,159
result what used to be one language is

41
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:24,000
now officially more than 30 different

42
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,079
languages actually that too is a lot

43
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:27,439
like what's going on with species on

44
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,960
earth like for a long time scientists

45
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,159
considered drafts to be a single species

46
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:33,799
but recent genetic research has revealed

47
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:35,159
that there are actually Four separately

48
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:37,280
evolving groups of drafts prompting a

49
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,880
proposal to quadruple the official

50
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,040
number of giraffe species out there so

51
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,560
the number of known languages currently

52
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,240
spoken on earth and the number of

53
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,719
described species currently living on

54
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:48,119
Earth are both officially increasing but

55
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:49,439
only because we're getting better and

56
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,000
pickier about documenting and

57
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,759
categorizing what's out there not

58
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:54,799
because we're actually gaining diversity

59
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:56,799
I mean sure new species and new

60
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,520
languages are still occasionally

61
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,320
evolving but that's a really slow

62
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,640
process as our planet globalizes and

63
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,799
homogenizes existing species and

64
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,920
languages are going extinct way faster

65
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,160
than new ones are evolving soon it's

66
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,679
likely that we'll reach Peak language

67
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:12,800
and Peak species that is we'll have

68
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,319
documented and nitpicked basically all

69
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:16,360
we can yet we'll be losing languages and

70
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,440
species faster than ever so the official

71
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,120
counts will begin to reflect the reality

72
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,640
on the ground which is depressing

73
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,680
occasionally though we might be able to

74
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,360
raise a language or species from the

75
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,000
dead we're still working on figuring out

76
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,360
how to clone dinosaurs but you're

77
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,680
that indigenous language that died in

78
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,599
2013 is alive again it's actively being

79
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:36,640
taught in some high schools and today

80
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,760
more than 300 kids speak it proficiently

81
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,159
so despite all the linguistic and

82
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:41,840
biological diversity we're losing

83
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,360
perhaps every once in a while life and

84
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,720
language will find a

85
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,440
way to understand and play with data

86
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,920
like the number of languages or species

87
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,400
in the world or anything else you're

88
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,440
interested in you need to practice and

ton of new data courses all of which use

97
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,120
real world data to train you to see

98
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,440
Trends and to make better informed

99
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,200
decisions I'm currently making my way

100
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,440
through their new course on exploring

101
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,120
data visually we I'm playing with real

102
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,720
