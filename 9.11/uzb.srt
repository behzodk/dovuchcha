(gentle music)

- [Narrator] At exactly 8:32
AM on a sunny morning in 2001,

President Bush leaves his room
at the Colony Beach Resort

in Florida and gets into
his Presidential limousine,

heading to a local elementary school.

The reason for this visit

is that he's promoting
a new education program.

On the scale of priority,
this is the kind of event

that would be forgotten by history.

However, just minutes before
Bush arrives at the school,

a breaking news message makes the rounds,

one that will forever change
the course of history.

At 8:46 AM, Flight 11 crashes

into the North Tower of
the World Trade Center.

And the news of this event
spreads in a, until then,

historically unprecedented manner.

Just one minute and 28
seconds after the impact,

a camera crew from WNYW goes on air.

- [Reporter] Jim, just a few moments ago,

something believed to be a plane,

crashed into the South Tower
of the World Trade Center.

- [Narrator] At 8:49 AM,

CNN pauses their programming
to cover the crash,

followed by CNBC, ABC, NBC,

CBS, Fox News

and international television stations.

In less than 10 minutes,

the eyes of the whole world
were focused on New York City.

However, nothing is known about the causes

at this point in time,

and speculation about a possible accident

is circulating in Sarasota,

where Bush is preparing
to head into the school.

Right along Bush's side,

is White House Press
Secretary Ari Fleischer,

who throughout the day is
taking handwritten notes

that reveal how everything unfolded

from the President's perspective,

with White House Chief of Staff Karl Rove

informing the President about the impact

just before he heads into
the school for the event.

As the nation listens to TV anchors

speculating potential
reasons for the crash,

the President listens to school
children reading stories.

There's still the possibility

that it could all be
just a tragic accident.

But a few minutes later, this
possibility can be ruled out.

At 9:03 AM, United Flight 175
heads for the South Tower.

Exactly two minutes elapsed

as the news circulated among reporters

and White House staff,

with the President being
one of the few people

unaware of what's going
on until eventually,

the White House Chief of
Staff leans into Bush's ear

and says, "A second plane
hit the second tower.

America is under attack."

A few miles away, at this time,

a US government modified Boeing 747

with the usual call sign, Air Force One,

prepares to take the President
back on a short journey

to Washington DC.

What no one can predict at this point

is that the President
will be on that plane

for much longer today.

After the school event was cut short,

senior White House staff gathers
in an adjoining classroom

for a briefing, following the news on TV,

much like the rest of the country,

and an initial statement was prepared.

- Today we've had a national tragedy.

- [Narrator] Simultaneously,

the Air Force is clearing the way

for a seamless flight of
the Presidential plane.

- [Air Base Staff] I need
you guys to keep a good eye

on Air Force One today and make
sure that it gets priority.

They're gonna probably
be taking off early here

to come back to Washington D.C.

So is there any way that
you can help us out on that?

- [Command Center Staff] Yeah.

- [Air Base Staff] They're out of Sarasota

and they'll be coming back
probably in the next hour,

I believe.

- [Narrator] But whether
Bush should really return

to the capital in this
situation is unclear,

as the attacks on the nation continue.

While the President is in his limousine

heading to the airport, he's
informed of yet another strike.

- [News Anchor] This is
coming at 9:43 Eastern time.

We're looking at a live
picture from Washington

and there is smoke pouring
out of the Pentagon.

- [Narrator] About 10
minutes after the strike

against the Pentagon,

Air Force One is about to
take off from Sarasota.

The Secret Service had received reports

that a person with an unclear device

was near one end of the runway,

and the fear was that
it might be a weapon.

Even though later, it turned
out to be nothing but a camera.

As a precaution, the pilot
decided to turn the plane around

and take off from the other side

so as not to be in the line of
sight of a possible shooter.

Unlike usual,

the plane also climbs at
an extremely steep angle,

a safety maneuver that can
protect against ground attacks.

As Air Force One
continues to gain altitude

heading towards the capital city,

one other plane over US airspace

is still under the
control of the hijackers.

Flight 93, initially
heading to San Francisco,

had changed course.

Now, also approaching Washington DC.

As it later turns out, the
passengers of this flight

had heard of the attacks on New York

and initiated a revolt
against the hijackers,

with passengers attempting
to gain control.

At 10:03 AM, Flight 93 crashes
in a field in Pennsylvania.

Although the revolt was unsuccessful

in saving the passengers,

it did save lives by
preventing the hijackers

from reaching their destination.

Meanwhile, aboard Air Force One,

heated debates are raging
about where the President

should be flying at this time.

Bush himself had given the
order to return to Washington.

But in the midst of an ongoing threat,

the Secret Service was
not about to risk it.

Bush was barred, or at
least strongly discouraged

from returning to DC.

Instead, Barksdale Air Force
Base in Louisiana was chosen.

Here, Air Force One can then refuel,

and a longer plan can be
devised for where the President

can most effectively carry out his duties.

As the plane heads for Louisiana,

growing concerns are also
raised about the possibility

of Air Force One itself becoming a target.

While the plane is equipped
with flares and smoke screens

to detect radar and heat-guided missiles,

it has no way to protect itself

against an airliner collision.

- [Herndon Center Staff] Air Force One

is filing a random route, by the way.

- [FAA Staff] Okay.

- [Herndon Center Staff] We
don't know where they decided

to go, but they still don't
have a fighter escort.

- [FAA Staff] They still do not?

- [Herndon Center Staff] That's correct.

- [FAA Staff] Holy cow.

- [Narrator] Adding to this concern

is the fact that some airplane

were not immediately
responding to ATC calls,

which led to the wrong belief

that there might be an
additional free aircraft

still missing.

Every plane in the sky was
seen as a possible threat now,

therefore Air Force One started climbing

to an extremely high flight level,

above the usual cruising
altitude for commercial flights

heading up to 45,000 feet,
so they can outrun anybody.

While lateral movement is
more difficult to track,

Air Force One had this
altitude for itself.

And then, towards the end of
their flight to Louisiana,

Air Force One was joined
by two fighter jets

that had taken off from
Joint Reserve Base Ellington

to escort the President
for the final few minutes.

Throughout the flight,

Air Force One's normally
stable telephone lines

were suddenly unreliable,

making communications
with the White House,

where Vice President Cheney

was sheltered in a secret
bunker, very difficult.

Communication networks across the country

were at their limit that day.

And Air Force One wasn't an exception.

And it was during this flight

when a controversial
military order was made,

one that until today,

is a controversial topic of discussion.

In the bunker below the White House,

there were ongoing fears
that another hijacked plane

was flying towards Washington DC.

It later turned out
that this was Flight 93,

which crashed in Pennsylvania
10 minutes earlier.

However, the information about the crash

had not yet reached the White House.

And between 10:12 and 10:18 AM,

Vice President Cheney was asked

whether this plane should be shot down

if it continued to head
towards the capital.

According to witnesses, as
well as Cheney's own biography,

he replied without hesitation

and gave the go ahead
for the shooting down

of a commercial plane that poses danger.

The problem with such an order, however,

is that Cheney, as Vice President,

is not part of the
military chain of command.

According to this hierarchy,

such an order comes from the President,

with the only other person in question

being the Secretary of
Defense, Donald Rumsfeld,

who is second in line to the President.

Rumsfeld could not be reached,

because he was at the Pentagon,

which was itself the target of an attack,

and he was busy helping
with rescue work on-site.

Standing in the same
secure room as Dick Cheney

when he made that order,

was White House Deputy Chief
of Staff Joshua Bolten.

After Cheney made the order,
he immediately asked Cheney

to call the President
to confirm this command.

Cheney does exactly so,

and rings Air Force One at 10:18 AM

to speak with the President.

According to the investigation report,

this phone call lasts two minutes,

which lines up with the notes

that Ari Fleischer took at 10:20 AM.

These notes show the words,

"authorized shot down if necessary."

The question, however, remains.

Did Vice President Cheney
initially give a command

that he wasn't entitled to give?

He himself denied it,

and stated that he had
already confirmed this order

in a previous conversation with Bush.

And in fact, Fleischer's notes
do show that Bush and Cheney

spoke on the phone beforehand,

visible in the above entry at 9:45 AM.

However, there is no
sign of a conversation

about a possible shootdown.

Whether the two spoke about this or not

can not be answered conclusively.

Upon landing at Barksdale Air Force Base,

a more detailed briefing took place,

and the President once
again addressed the nation.

- Freedom itself was
attacked this morning.

- [Narrator] As Bush delivers his speech,

his security team and national advisors

have come up with a new destination.

The President is determined
to head to the White House,

saying, "I want to go back home, ASAP.

And I don't want whoever this is,

holding me outside Washington."

But the Secret Service
disagrees, with Eddie Marinzel,

the President's lead Secret
Service agent, saying,

"Our people are saying
it's too unsteady still."

Therefore, at 1:48 PM,

Air Force One takes off
from Barksdale Base,

heading not for Washington,

but for the Offut Air
Force Base in Nebraska.

The reason they decided to go here

is that this base has
the US STRATCOM bunker,

an immensely protected
underground compound

with advanced communication capabilities.

On this journey to Nebraska,

Air Force One was flying
almost entirely alone

in American airspace.

Already at 9:45 AM, one
hour after the first strike,

a complete closure of all
US airspace was ordered,

after which aircraft had to land

at the nearest possible airport.

At around 12:15, this
closure was completed,

with all commercial and
general aviation grounded.

After landing at Offut Air Force Base,

the President and his team gathered

in the US STRATCOM bunker.

It is located 40 feet
underground and is thickly built

to provide protection
from any possible attacks.

In addition to an extensive
communication center,

there are also several
other rooms with offices

and even bedrooms, so that
this station could function

as an overnight base, if necessary.

At 4:36 PM, the act of
attacks on the nation

seemed to have come to an end,

and the security situation
allows the President

to take his third flight of the day.

Air Force One departs, bound
for Joint Base Andrews.

But even this flight was carried out

under immense security concerns

as the Secret Service not
only worries about security

in the airspace,

but also considers
possible threats on board.

One not frequently reported on concern

was that just a few hours earlier,

a call had come in at the
White House switchboard

with a message that resulted
in the worst of fears.

The message on the call
was "Angel is next."

Angel is the internal code
word for Air Force One,

and what is especially concerning

is the fact that this code
word was not publicly known,

leading Secret Service
agents to suspect an insider

might be plotting an attack on the plane.

In face of this ominous message,

the Secret Service decided
to permanently station agents

in the aisle of the Presidential area.

Additionally,

another agent was placed
near the cockpit door,

ready to defend it from any intruders.

In the later investigation into
the events of September 11,

it'll appear that a number
of misunderstandings

had led to this warning,

and that these exact words
were not uttered on the phone.

It was one of many false alarms that day

that severely raised tensions
aboard Air Force One.

At 6:44 PM, Air Force One lands
at Andrews Air Force Base.

From here,

the President flies on Marine
One to the White House,

where he will address the
nation from the Oval Office

that same evening.

A simple journey that was supposed to take

just two and a half hours,

turned into a tense relay
race between Sarasota, Florida

and the White House in DC.

All in all, it took more than nine hours,

a time period in which
thousands of lives were lost

in an attack that will
shape the next decades.

As for Air Force One,

this was arguably the most serious test

of its safety capabilities
that ever occurred.

Many of the protocols were shown to work

and the pilots made decisions
to ensure maximum safety.

At the same time, the day
also revealed weaknesses

with a large delay until the
flight could be escorted,

as well as confusion due to false reports,

and an unreliable communication network.

All things that were improved
on in the following years.

The September 11 attacks
brought the realities

of global events directly into
our homes through cable news.

In the more than 20 years since,

the media landscape has
changed dramatically.

Today, outlets not only
rely on TV ratings,

but also on generating clicks,

leading to increasingly divisive headlines

and stories designed to provoke outrage.

And it's easy to fall into this cycle

of only reading articles
that confirm our opinions.

To better navigate this, I
personally use Ground News,

the sponsor of this video.

Their app allows you to see

how different news outlets
report on the same story,

helping you spot biases.

For example,

this story about the
Donald Trump criminal case,

which interestingly is almost
exclusively reported on

by right-leaning media.

The story as written up
by right-wing outlets

is that the judge in the trial

against former President Trump

has told the jury that
they do not need to believe

Trump is guilty to convict
him, which if it was true,

would be a scandal.

However, Ground News
also rates the factuality

of these outlets,

and it provides a different
article that clarifies.

What the judge actually said

is that jurors can disagree
on the mechanism of his guilt,

but very well have to be unanimous
on whether guilty or not.

Ground News highlights
these blind spots for you.

That is, when a story is
disproportionately covered

by either left or right-leaning media,

and it lets you compare headlines

to see which spin
different outlets will give

a certain topic,

so you can see every side of
what the political spectrum

is saying about the same story.

Ground News also provides information

on the ownership
structure of news outlets.

Plus you can track your own news bias

based on the articles that you read.

In order to access all
these amazing features,

It truly is a fantastic
way to stay informed

without falling into an echo chamber.

So thank you for checking out Ground News,

and thank you so much
for watching this video.
