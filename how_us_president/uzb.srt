it functions as the motor Cates

00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,680

operational at all

00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:09,000
times the car provides satellite and

178
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,520
internet communications and it feeds a

00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,000
direct encrypted link to the Pentagon

180
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,120

00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,639
on

183
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:23,479
road at the back of the motorcade a

184
00:08:23,479 --> 00:08:26,520
local ambulance will follow just in case

185
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:29,560
anything happens and signifying the end

186
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:32,240
of the motorcade are the so-called rear

187
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,919
guards local police cars that make sure

188
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:36,958
that no other cars drive into the

00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:40,038
motorade from the

190
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,800
back at this point the presidential

191
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,440
limousine arrives at the intersection

192
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,399
with the

193
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:54,080
van quickly a man jumps

194
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,519
out and aims the rocket launcher

195
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:01,000

00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,360
for this case the presidential

00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,880
limousines and the electronic

199
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,959
countermeasure vehicle are equipped with

200
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:11,800
smoke grenades as soon as they are

00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,040
triggered the cars disappear in the

202
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:17,839
Smoke preventing a clear line of sight

203
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:20,560
this so-called infrared smoke screen is

204
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,040
composed in such a way that it conceals

205
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,360
the heat signature of objects that means

206
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:29,560
that even more complex guided missile

207
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:32,560
would not succeed in tracking the

208
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:37,800
target meanwhile the Beast fle the

209
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,680
scene the presidential motorcade is a

210
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,839
highly fought for system although the

211
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:46,480
enormous number of cars may seem a bit

212
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,279
arbitrary at first glance a closer look

213
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:51,480
reveals that the different Vehicles all

214
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:54,200
fulfill different tasks and together

215
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:57,399
function as a White House on Wheels

216
00:09:57,399 --> 00:09:59,760
though it's probably fair to say that

217
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,160
besides Justified security concerns

218
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,800
there's also some element of projecting

219
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,000
power at play

220
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:14,320
here today the motorcade managed to

221
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,640
successfully avert three different

222
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,600
dangers but the motorcade is only one

223
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,320
part of a huge security apparatus with

224
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,519
another element being Air Force 1 the

225
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:28,040
call sign for a heavily modified Boeing

226
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,880
747 on which the president

227
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,000
travels this plane was severely tested

228
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,200
when it served as a refuge for George

229
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,079
Bush during the attacks on the country

230
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:41,839
on September 11 2001 with the president

231
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:44,880
spending much of that day on

232
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,160
board for my next video I took a look at

233
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,279
this special perspective on September 11

234
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:53,720
and you can watch that video already

235
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,440
right now on nebula where I upload all

236
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:59,360
my videos first and not only not only

237
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,639
that nebula is also where you can see

238
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:03,880
exclusive videos that I made just for

239
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:06,399
nebula subscribers such as the one I

240
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:09,040
produced about the bin Laden raid

241
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:12,200
detailing how this military operation

242
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,360
unfolded because nebula is a

243
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,600
subscription service I can work with

244
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,040
higher budgets for these videos creating

245
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,200
way more ambitious projects and this

246
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,399
support has enabled me to increase my

247
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:25,720
production quality for my YouTube videos

248
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,720
as well allowing me to do things I could

249
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,399
have only dreamed of 2 years

250
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:33,560
ago besides me you can find incredible
