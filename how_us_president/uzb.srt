1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:03,600
it is the worst nightmare of the Secret

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,359
Service an attack on the president of

3
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:09,480
the United States while he's traveling

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,639
hidden beneath this manhole cover is a

5
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:14,519
bomb that went undetected and it can be

6
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:16,279
triggered

7
00:00:16,279 --> 00:00:18,880
remotely just seconds from now the

8
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,039
presidential motorcade will be passing

9
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:24,880
over exactly this spot but this is not

10
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,199
the only

11
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:30,439
danger a few blocks away there is is a

12
00:00:30,439 --> 00:00:34,120
second fret located in a dimly lit room

13
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:36,960
a sniper is overlooking the intersection

14
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,800
where the president will soon

15
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:43,200
be and a little further down the road a

16
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,440
van with tinted windows is parked close

17
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:49,800
to the blocked off streets inside a man

18
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,399
is preparing a rocket launcher that will

19
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:55,199
soon be aimed at the

20
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:57,719
motorcade fortunately these free

21
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:00,559
scenarios are purely fictional but they

22
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:02,680
will demonstrate the rigorous effort the

23
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:05,239
Secret Service undertakes to ensure that

24
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:09,080
the president remains secure during

25
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:11,400
travel while the president is still

26
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,400
about 2 minutes away from the manhole

27
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,720
cover with the bomb the first car of the

28
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:18,520
motor Cate the route car is already

29
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:20,680
driving past this

30
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:23,400
spot this car together with the pilot

31
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,000
car ensures that the road is clear of

32
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,479
obstructions the sweepers which are

33
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:31,159
primarily motorcycles follow the route

34
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:33,759
car and pilot car and help clear the

35
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:35,079
road

36
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:37,720
ahead however they are unable to

37
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:40,200
identify the bomb and the core of the

38
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,439
motorcade consisting of Secret Service

39
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:46,079
vehicles with the president on board is

40
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,880
approaching as the president's limousine

41
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,040
rolls towards the manhole cover a person

42
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:56,240
remotely pulls the trigger and

43
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,840
suddenly nothing

44
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,399
happens

45
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:03,200
the remote trigger didn't work and that

46
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,399
is because of this car the electronic

47
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:09,000
countermeasure Suburban one of the most

48
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,120
technically impressive vehicles in the

49
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,879
motor Cate on its roof antennas emit

50
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,319
radio frequencies that drown out any

51
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:20,480
bomb activation signal this technique is

52
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,000
called barage jamming and it essentially

53
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,319
works by the antennas emitting such a

54
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:27,879
strong noise signal that other signals

55
00:02:27,879 --> 00:02:30,440
simply cannot get through

56
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,440
and so the motorcade continues

57
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:35,519
undisturbed towards the second threat

58
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:38,000
the sniper in the

59
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,959
window located behind the electronic

60
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:42,720
countermeasure Suburban is the

61
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,040
president's vehicle commonly known by

62
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,120
its nickname the Beast however you can

63
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,560
never be sure in which car the president

64
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,879
is as there are two identical

65
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:55,640
presidential limousines on the road

66
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:58,159
following behind are two cars carrying

67
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:00,560
the president's most important security

68
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,120
Personnel ready to take action in the

69
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,200
event of an attack this is the so-called

70
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,879
halfback in which the president's

71
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:09,920
personal Secret Service agents are

72
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,040
located no matter what happens these

73
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,640
agents will stay with the

74
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:18,239
president the other car carries the

75
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,040
counter assault team these heavily armed

76
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,319
agents can remain on site and fight off

77
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:28,000
and attack this creates a secure buffer

78
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,080
between attackers and the

79
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,799
president Behind these cars are the

80
00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:37,280
control car and the support car these

81
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,239
transport additional Secret Service

82
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:42,239
agents essential presidential staff as

83
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,840
well as the president's personal

84
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:48,200
doctor but unknown to any of them they

85
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:51,000
are currently approaching another threat

86
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,159
as the motorcade arrives at the

87
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:56,159
intersection the sniper has scouted

88
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,599
out the fact that there are two

89
00:03:58,599 --> 00:04:01,079
identical cars makes it difficult for

90
00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:04,040
the shooter but unfortunately he catches

91
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:07,159
a glimpse through the glass aims and

92
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:09,840
pulls the

93
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:16,560
trigger such a scenario naturally brings

94
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,519
back memories of the 1963 assassination

95
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,040
of John F Kennedy who was shot while

96
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,320
driving his motorcade through

97
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,120
Dallas since that time the presidential

98
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,720
limousine has undergone many changes

99
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,680
Kennedy's car was a specially modified

100
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,759
1961 Lincoln

101
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,840
Continental unfortunately though only a

102
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:41,440
few of the adjustments made were related

103
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,120
to security

104
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,840
improvements the car was retrofitted

105
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,120
with a luxurious heating and air

106
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,639
conditioning system as well as lights

107
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:53,320
Sirens fire extinguishers and radio

108
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:56,479
telephones for communication the car was

109
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:59,280
also extended to include a middle row of

110
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,199
jump pump seats that can fold away when

111
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:05,600
not in use in addition the roof was made

112
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,120
to be completely removable and the

113
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,000
cushion on the rear Bank where the

114
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,160
president sits was raised both these

115
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,520
modifications were designed to make the

116
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,600
president more visible to the public

117
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:22,120
unfortunately it also made him more

118
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,840
vulnerable after Kennedy's assassination

119
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:28,440
the car was massively rebuilt a top of

120
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:31,039
bulletproof glass was installed and the

121
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,520
body of the car was now protected with

122
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,520
titanium armor perhaps somewhat symbolic

123
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,600
the light convertible appearance

124
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,560
representative of a hopeful time was

125
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,680
built up into a tank set to protect his

126
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,680
more divisive

127
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:51,919
successor luckily today's limousine is

128
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:54,639
well prepared for such an attack and the

129
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:58,479
shot has absolutely no chance of

130
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:01,199
success

131
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,240
the current Beast has been in service

132
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:06,639
since September 2018 and is a completely

133
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:09,800
custombuilt vehicle by General Motors

134
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,440
although visually reminiscent of a sedon

135
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,319
the car was actually built based on a

136
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:17,120
truck platform this was necessary to

137
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,280
support the over 15,000lb heavy armored

138
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:23,039
vehicle the interior is hermetically

139
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:25,520
sealed against any form of chemical

140
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,440
attack the tires are able to continue

141
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:31,639
driving even when shot and the doors are

142
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:34,639
8 in thick and equipped with handles

143
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:36,880
that with the switch of a button can be

144
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,120
electrified in order to prohibit entry

145
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,120
to

146
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:43,120
Outsiders always inside the car there is

147
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,680
a storage of blood of the same blood

148
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,639
type as the president it is a luxury

149
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:53,000
tank designed to withstand any possible

150
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,720
threat but the biggest challenge in our

151
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:58,720
scenario is Yet to Come As just two

152
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,240
blocks away way the van with the rocket

153
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:05,360
launcher prepares to test the car's

154
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,080
endurance behind the solid core of

155
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,960
vehicles directly protecting the

156
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:13,560
president are a few larger Vans these

157
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,800
carry the Press pool of reporters that

158
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,360
travel with the

159
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,720
president this car behind is the ID car

160
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,440
it functions as the motor Cates

161
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,319
Communications Hub relaying information

162
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:28,720
between the different vehicles and

163
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,919
identify in problems early

164
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:34,639
on behind that is the Hazardous

165
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:37,680
Materials mitigation unit a vehicle

166
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,039
equipped to respond to biological

167
00:07:40,039 --> 00:07:42,800
chemical and even nuclear

168
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,599
attacks it carries the necessary

169
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:48,000
equipment and Personnel to treat the

170
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
effects of such an attack

171
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,680
effectively this is the so-called Road

172
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,479
Runner recognizable by the antenna above

173
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:59,319
the roof this car is the mobile

174
00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:01,639
communication Hub of the motorcade

175
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:03,800
ensuring that the president is fully

176
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,800
operational at all

177
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:09,000
times the car provides satellite and

178
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,520
internet communications and it feeds a

179
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,000
direct encrypted link to the Pentagon

180
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,120
allowing the president to hold secure

181
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:19,000
phone and video conversations even when

182
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,639
on

183
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:23,479
road at the back of the motorcade a

184
00:08:23,479 --> 00:08:26,520
local ambulance will follow just in case

185
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:29,560
anything happens and signifying the end

186
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:32,240
of the motorcade are the so-called rear

187
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,919
guards local police cars that make sure

188
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:36,958
that no other cars drive into the

189
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:40,038
motorade from the

190
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,800
back at this point the presidential

191
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,440
limousine arrives at the intersection

192
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,399
with the

193
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:54,080
van quickly a man jumps

194
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,519
out and aims the rocket launcher

195
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:01,000
directly at the limousine

[Music]

197
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,360
for this case the presidential

198
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,880
limousines and the electronic

199
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,959
countermeasure vehicle are equipped with

200
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:11,800
smoke grenades as soon as they are

201
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,040
triggered the cars disappear in the

202
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:17,839
Smoke preventing a clear line of sight

203
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:20,560
this so-called infrared smoke screen is

204
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,040
composed in such a way that it conceals

205
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,360
the heat signature of objects that means

206
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:29,560
that even more complex guided missile

207
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:32,560
would not succeed in tracking the

208
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:37,800
target meanwhile the Beast fle the

209
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,680
scene the presidential motorcade is a

210
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,839
highly fought for system although the

211
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:46,480
enormous number of cars may seem a bit

212
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,279
arbitrary at first glance a closer look

213
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:51,480
reveals that the different Vehicles all

214
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:54,200
fulfill different tasks and together

215
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:57,399
function as a White House on Wheels

216
00:09:57,399 --> 00:09:59,760
though it's probably fair to say that

217
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,160
besides Justified security concerns

218
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,800
there's also some element of projecting

219
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,000
power at play

220
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:14,320
here today the motorcade managed to

221
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,640
successfully avert three different

222
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,600
dangers but the motorcade is only one

223
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,320
part of a huge security apparatus with

224
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,519
another element being Air Force 1 the

225
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:28,040
call sign for a heavily modified Boeing

226
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,880
747 on which the president

227
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,000
travels this plane was severely tested

228
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,200
when it served as a refuge for George

229
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,079
Bush during the attacks on the country

230
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:41,839
on September 11 2001 with the president

231
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:44,880
spending much of that day on

232
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,160
board for my next video I took a look at

233
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,279
this special perspective on September 11

234
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:53,720
and you can watch that video already

235
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,440
right now on nebula where I upload all

236
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:59,360
my videos first and not only not only

237
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,639
that nebula is also where you can see

238
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:03,880
exclusive videos that I made just for

239
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:06,399
nebula subscribers such as the one I

240
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:09,040
produced about the bin Laden raid

241
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:12,200
detailing how this military operation

242
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,360
unfolded because nebula is a

243
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,600
subscription service I can work with

244
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,040
higher budgets for these videos creating

245
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,200
way more ambitious projects and this

246
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,399
support has enabled me to increase my

247
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:25,720
production quality for my YouTube videos

248
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,720
as well allowing me to do things I could

249
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,399
have only dreamed of 2 years

250
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:33,560
ago besides me you can find incredible

251
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:36,079
