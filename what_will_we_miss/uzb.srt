1
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:03,879
Hey, Vsauce.

2
00:00:03,879 --> 00:00:07,149
Maykl bu yerda.
6009-yil

3
00:00:07,149 --> 00:00:11,690
1961-yildan buyon Arab yozuvida yozilganda va

4
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:15,109
teskarisiga o'girilganda ham bir xil
ko'rinadigan

5
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:19,750
birinchi yil bo'ladi.
Lekin siz va men

6
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:23,369
6009-yildan rohatlanish uchun 
yetarlicha uzoq yashamaymiz.

7
00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:26,590
Odamlar shunchaki bunchalik uzoq yashamaydÄ±.

8
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:32,119
Biz bu voqeani o'tkazib
yuboramiz. Biz yana nimalarni

9
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:35,380
o'tkazib yuboramiz?
Ho'sh, avvalambor,

10
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:39,670
siz-u men Wemding, Germaniyadagi
piramida tugallanishigacha uzoq

11
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:44,640
yashamaymiz. Bu oxiroqibat
120 beton bloklardan iborat

12
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,710
bo'ladigan piramidadir.
Ammo quruvchilar

13
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:52,730
har 10 yilda atiga bitta blok o'rnatishmoqda.

14
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:55,739
1993-yil qurilishi boshlangandan

15
00:00:55,739 --> 00:01:01,390
buyon atiga to'rttasi qurildi.
Bu ketishda piramida 3183-yilda

16
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:04,950
tugallanadi.

17
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:06,520
The final block placed by
Oxirgi blok

18
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:11,200
bizning nevara, evara, chevara, xullas
30-avlodimiz tomonidan

19
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,610
o'rnatiladi.
Lekin xatto ular ham

20
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:18,530
Chernobilda shod va xafvsiz o'ynay
olmaydilar.

21
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:21,680
Mn qilingan zona.
Xaroba makon.

22
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,909
1986-yilgi xalokatdagi
radioktiv ifloslanish inson hayoti

23
00:01:25,909 --> 00:01:28,549
uchun xafvsiz holatiga qaytishga

24
00:01:28,549 --> 00:01:33,439
kerak bo'ladigan vaqt 4000 yil emas, 5000 yil emas,

25
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:37,909
va bu hattoki 6000 yil ham emas.
Bu joy oxide-oqibat 22000-

26
00:01:37,909 --> 00:01:42,889
yilda yana xafvsiz bo'ladi.

27
00:01:42,889 --> 00:01:46,880
Ehtimol, hayotimiz davomidamasdir,
ammo keyingi million yil ichida

28
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:48,060
Betalgiza,

29
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:51,320
va Eta Krini kabi yulduzlar Supernova

30
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:54,720
yulduziga birlashadi va u xatto yerdan

31
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:59,259
ham ko'rinadi. Xafaman, albatta, 
bu xodisalarni o'tkazib yuboraman

32
00:01:59,259 --> 00:02:00,350
va bu 

33
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:03,520
Ikki haftaga yerning ikki quyoshi bo'lganday

34
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:09,080
ko'rinadi. garchi yuzlab,
minglab yorug'lik yili uzoqda sodir,

35
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:13,239
bo'lsada, ularning supernovalari oydanda
yorqinroq ko'rinardi.

36
00:02:13,239 --> 00:02:16,480
Eng qizig'i bu kunduz kuni ham ko'rinadi.

37
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:21,670
Lekin haqiqiy osmon tomoshasi 3.75

38
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:25,640
milliard yildan so'ng kuzatiladi.
Gallaktikamiz

39
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:29,129
yulduzlarga to'la, yerdan ular

40
00:02:29,129 --> 00:02:32,890
osmondagi sut tomchilariga o'xshaydi va bu biz

41
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:36,640
Sutli yo'l gallaktikasi deyishimizning sababidir.

42
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,120
Bundan tashqari barcha galaktikalar sut

43
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:43,420
nomiga qo'yilgan. Sut, laktoza

44
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:47,049
lactic, ga-lactic, galaktika

45
00:02:47,049 --> 00:02:51,189
Osmondagi har bir sut tomchisi,
siz ko'radigan har bir yulduz,

46
00:02:51,189 --> 00:02:54,439
galaktikamiz - Sutli Yo'lning ichida.

47
00:02:54,439 --> 00:02:57,939
Lekin bir xira, shakl bor

48
00:02:57,939 --> 00:03:02,569
Mana bu narsa.
Bu yulduz emas, galaktikamizdagi gaz buluti

49
00:03:02,569 --> 00:03:06,349
emas, bu umuman boshqa bir

50
00:03:06,349 --> 00:03:09,859
Galaktika - Andromeda Galaktikasi va u bizdan ikki

51
00:03:09,859 --> 00:03:15,420
yarim million yorug'lik yili uzoqda.
U bizdagiga qaraganda ikki barobar ko'p

52
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:16,379
yulduz bor.

53
00:03:16,379 --> 00:03:20,230
va u bizga qarab kelmoqda.
300 kilometer sekund

54
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:23,730
tezlikda bizga yaqinlashmoqda, o'qdandda

55
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:27,870
tez.
Ayni vaqtda osmon bunday ko'rinadi.

56
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:31,689
2 milliard yil ichida Andromeda
shunchalik yaqinlashgan bo'ladiki

57
00:03:31,689 --> 00:03:34,870
odamlar osmonga qaraydi va mana buni

58
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:39,409
ko'radi.
3.75 milliard yil ichida esa osmon

59
00:03:39,409 --> 00:03:43,659
xuddi ilmiy fantastik kino sahnasiga yoki
kompyuter muqovasiga o'xshab qoladi.

60
00:03:43,659 --> 00:03:47,519
Maftunkor va qo'rqinchli.

61
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:53,060
Bu hodisadan so'ng, osmon tom ma'noda
yangi yulduzlar bilan porlayotgan bo'ladi

62
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:58,079
ayni Somon Yo'li va Andromeda to'qnashib,
maftunkor kosmik ranglar aralashmasiga
63
00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:02,690
aylanayotgan paytda. Bu simulyatsiya Andromeda
Somon Yo'li bilan qanday to'qnashishini ko'rsatib
64
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:03,150
beradi,

65
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:06,190
but keep in mind that you are watching billions
biroq siz har soniyada milliardlab yillar o'tishini

66
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:09,919
of years pass every second.
ko'rayotganingizni yodda tuting.
Bu galaktikalar

67
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:13,169
are moving fast but they're also huge
tez harakatlanyapti lekin ulan ulkan hamdir
68
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:16,760
and covering even huger distances.
va kattaroq masofa qoplashayapti.
They
Ular
69
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:20,829
will collide in the future but within the briefness
kelajakda to'qnashishadi ammo yagona insin umrining

70
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:24,830
of a single human life they appear almost frozen,
qisqaligida ular deyarli harkatlanmay muzlab qolganga

71
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:29,180
unmoving.
o'xshaydi.
A couple billion years after colliding
To'qnashuvdan bir qancha millard yil so'ng

72
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:32,960
the course of both galaxies will be
ikkala galaktikaning taqdiri
married together
yorqin, otashin

73
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,199
markazda birlashib qoladi.
Hozirda Yer

74
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:39,509
a stepchild to what was once Andromeda,

75
00:04:39,509 --> 00:04:42,590
part of a new, bigger family called

76
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:48,539
Milkdromeda. It would be so cool to be
alive to see our galaxy

77
00:04:48,539 --> 00:04:52,260
colliding with another.
But don't get all fomo,

78
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:55,380
consumed by a fear of missing

79
00:04:55,380 --> 00:05:01,039
out. Because whatever life is around then
will have plenty to envy us for.

80
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:05,610
They may have spectacular nightly views,
but secretly wish they'd been born in

81
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:06,360
our time

82
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,820
to experience, say, the beginning of the Internet.

83
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:13,930
They will actually miss out on a lot of things.

84
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:17,630
Because the Moon moves one centimetre
further away from

85
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:22,490
earth every year, 
600 million years from today

86
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:25,840
the Moon will no longer be close enough
to earth to completely

87
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,850
block out the Sun.

88
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:31,190
Future humans or descendants of humans
will therefore

89
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:35,169
miss out on a chance to ever see for themselves

90
00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:39,260
the beauty of the total solar eclipse
from the surface of Earth.

91
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:42,440
Long before earth dries up

92
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:45,500
Niagara Falls will dry up.
Well,

93
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:49,060
not the water part, but the falls part.

94
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:53,620
Every year the rushing water of Niagara
erodes the rock at the top of the

95
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:54,430
falls

96
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:58,889
one foot backward.
By the year 52 000

97
00:05:58,889 --> 00:06:03,570
it will have eroded all the way to
Lake Erie and our progeny will have no

98
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:04,979
Niagara Falls

99
00:06:04,979 --> 00:06:09,200
to enjoy.
Granite has an erosion rate of about

100
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:12,440
one inch per ten thousand years.

101
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:16,190
So, certainly by the year 7 million

102
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:20,380
Mount Rushmore, especially its faces, will no longer

103
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,419
exist.
And because they slowly get

104
00:06:23,419 --> 00:06:28,580
pulled in or rejected into space,
in 50 to 100 million years

105
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:32,410
Saturn will no longer have its lovely rings.

106
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:35,780
So, life on earth in the future

107
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:41,050
might have awesome supernovas and
galactic collisions to look forward to

108
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:44,600
but they probably won't have Niagara Falls,

109
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:48,700
Mount Rushmore, total solar eclipses or Saturn's rings.

110
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:52,310
They also won't have you.
But

111
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:55,700
you have you. Except not all of it.

112
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:59,500
Babies don't begin to form episodic
memories right

113
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:03,930
away, meaning that you missed out on. 
You don't remember two of the most seminal

114
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:05,490
events in your life.

115
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:08,690
Your conception and your birth.

116
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:12,100
But you can experience a bit of those moments

117
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,880
right now.
First of all,

118
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:20,380
When Was I Conceived? dot com
lets you enter your birthday

119
00:07:20,389 --> 00:07:23,990
and get back the week your parents probably made

120
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:28,190
you happen, as well as the number one
song and the number one movie of that

121
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:31,630
week, which may have also been involved.

122
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:35,420
Light travels quickly, the most quickest

123
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:39,539
in fact.
But it can take a photon millions

124
00:07:39,539 --> 00:07:45,340
of years to escape from the interior of the star
it was created in through nuclear fusion.

125
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:49,320
It takes time, just like your own gestation

126
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:52,789
in your mother's womb.
Newly conceived photons

127
00:07:52,789 --> 00:07:56,220
struggle through a dense stellar jungle

128
00:07:56,220 --> 00:08:00,479
of atoms and molecules and electrons that
absorb and reemit the photon, taking a

129
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,900
little bit of energy from it as a randomly

130
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:07,849
rolls around like a pinball.
Sometimes after thousands or millions of

131
00:08:07,849 --> 00:08:11,599
years it's random walk finally leads it to the stars'

132
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:15,270
surface, where it pops out into space.

133
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:21,870
In a way, is born. A lucky, tiny tiny tiny
percentage of the photons that reach the

134
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:23,159
surface of a star

135
00:08:23,159 --> 00:08:26,800
find themselves on a path that will intersect

136
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:31,229
with earth.
And if you are lucky, those photons will

137
00:08:31,229 --> 00:08:34,300
end their journey by being absorbed

138
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:39,180
under your own retina.
If you enter the date of your birth or the

139
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:43,169
approximate date of your conception into
this online calculator

140
00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:47,890
you can find a star that is as many
light years away from

141
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:53,670
earth as you are old.
When you look up at that start today,

142
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:57,870
you are seeing light that left the star the very month

143
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:01,459
you were born or photons that left that star

144
00:09:01,459 --> 00:09:05,470
and entered space when
your entire body was just

145
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:07,710
one cell.

146
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:13,040
Space is really big and your life is very short

147
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:18,160
but space is so gosh darn big you don't
have to miss out

148
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,740
on everything.

149
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,300
And as always,

150
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,680
thanks for watching.
