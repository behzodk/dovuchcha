00:00:00.000 Are you the person in the group who's always getting bitten by mosquitoes? Because I certainly am
00:00:05.180 and science has shown that this is a thing - that mosquitoes are more attracted to some people
00:00:09.280 than others. And the reason for that is at least partially genetic, which is why
00:00:13.360 this video is supported by 23andMe, a company that reads sections of your genetic code
00:00:18.260 and then helps you understand, what's in there.
00:00:21.600 Now, they've actually been involved in some research that has identified particular spots on your DNA
00:00:26.900 that make you more or less likely to be attractive to mosquitoes, and in this video
00:00:31.860 I want to put that to the test. So I flew to New Mexico State University
00:00:36.280 to meet mosquito man Professor Immo Hansen.
00:00:41.020 Everyone: Hello!
00:00:42.660 Hansen: We have a collection of lab strains
00:00:45.200 Derek: Here, he maintains colonies of many different species of mosquitoes, and one exotic strain
00:00:50.760 he actually feeds with his own blood(!)
00:00:53.420 Hansen: No, no, I'm serious. These ones are made from my blood.
00:00:56.740 D: Really!?H: Yes! Absolutely, yeah.
00:00:58.900 D: You feed these!?H: And I'm the only one feeding them - I can't ask my students, you know, that would be a nightmare
00:01:03.800 H: getting permissions to this room here.D: How do you blood feed them?
00:01:07.060 D: With just, sticking your arm in there?H: Well, I just put my arm in there and wait
00:01:12.120 D: Is it psychologically itchy or...?H: No it is really itchy [laughs]
00:01:16.560 H: Yeah, and I'm getting, I mean, 25 bites or so right now
00:01:20.880 D: Mosquitoes need our blood proteins to make their eggs, so only the female mosquitoes bite.
00:01:26.900 The eggs hatch into these wriggly larvae, which develop into pupae
00:01:31.200 before becoming flying, adult mosquitoes. Then they, once again, seek out vertebrate blood to make more eggs.
00:01:38.280 The whole lifecycle takes just two weeks! But what I wanted to know is: am I a desirable target?
00:01:45.820 D: How can we figure out if I'm attractive to mosquitoes?
00:01:49.020 H: Okay, we have a Y-tube, basically, which has a holding chamber. We put the mosquitoes down here,
00:01:54.900 H: there's a little fan inducing a draft, something like 4Â m/s.
00:01:59.100 We're gonna insert a bait into one of these chambers, in the green or the yellow one.
00:02:05.160 D: So, by bait, you're saying me?H: Yes, you, exactly.D: [laughs]
00:02:08.440 H: You put your hand in there. [It] would be good if you would rub your hand first, so
00:02:13.480 H: If you're sweaty...D: Get some oils?H: Yes!
00:02:15.940 D: This is the right spot...H: That's where the good stuff is, exactly.
00:02:20.780 H: Almost feeds exclusively on humans. They are really specialized on biting humans.
00:02:25.980 D: That's good to know...H: Yeah[both laugh]
00:02:29.180 H: There's 20 mosquitoes in the holding chamber.
00:02:31.440 D: And they're gonna decide whether to come and find me, or go down the other side and... they find nothing.
00:02:37.900 H: Right.D: We're releasing the mosquitoes. I see them coming!
00:02:41.660 D: Oh, he's chosen wrong!
00:02:45.380 H: Do you see that?
00:02:47.460 H: Man, you are attractive!
00:02:49.460 D: Really?H: I mean, sorry I-[both laugh]
00:02:52.840 H: You are a strong attractant to mosquitoes. They all went in your direction.D: None of them went the other way!
00:03:00.260 D: (laughing) This is amazing!
00:03:02.960 H: Well, there's one stranded in hereD: I did not expect to have such a strong... response, like
00:03:09.460 D: You see all those mosquitoes...
00:03:12.350 D: This type of test was actually used to discover that the basis for our attractiveness to mosquitoes is at least partially genetic.
00:03:19.480 Researchers recruited 18 pairs of identical female twins and 19 pairs of non identical, or fraternal female twins.
00:03:26.920 Then they used the Y-tube Test to evaluate the mosquito attractiveness of each individual,
00:03:31.380 measured by the fraction of mosquitoes who correctly flew to the arm of the tube where the twin was standing.
00:03:36.830 What scientists found is that the mosquito attractiveness of twins is
00:03:40.340 correlated, that is, the more attractive you are to mosquitoes, the more likely your twin is, too.
00:03:45.160 But that's... not all that surprising, and could be caused by environmental factors, or a common diet.
00:03:50.240 But, comparing identical twins to fraternal twins revealed the correlation was higher for identical twins.
00:03:57.440 This strongly suggests genetics influence how attractive you are to mosquitoes.
00:04:01.540 Since the identical twins share more of the same genes than fraternal twins, this explains
00:04:06.280 why their mosquito attractiveness would be more closely correlated if it really is genetics that
00:04:11.020 determines how much mosquitoes like you.
00:04:13.700 D: With that last test, I was clearly attractive to these mosquitoes.H: Yes.D: Except we weren't comparing me to any other human,
00:04:20.320 D: we were just comparing me to a control, no human.H: Exactly, yes.
00:04:24.460 D: So, what if we compare myself with my wife Raquel? [laughs]H: Uh-huh?
00:04:28.660 D: Normally, I get bitten and she doesn't.H: Okay.D: So this should be a good test... maybe?
00:04:34.000 D: To see whether under lab conditions...
00:04:36.580 H: We can we reproduce your...D: We'll reproduce our anecdotal finding. That I'm more attractive.H: Exactly, anecdotal evidence a little once again
00:04:42.960 H: They are a little...D: Once again...
00:04:45.340 D: ...preparing.
00:04:47.220 H: Okay!D: Hands in position!Raquel: Yeah.
00:04:49.600 H: Yeah, see, they actually start to wake up. They... smelled something. Something's going on here.R: Here we go.
00:04:56.220 H: Okay. D: What are we seein'?
00:04:58.740 D: Whoa!
00:05:01.220 D: I'm getting a good amount over here, but so are you?
00:05:05.080 D: Let's see. I think I'm getting more. It looks to me like you got three.
00:05:09.120 H: Okay, I'm gonna stop the experiment right now.D: Alright.
00:05:12.760 H: *chuck!* Okay, now let's count. I think it's seven on your side here?
00:05:18.800 Lab assistant: Five in the holding.H: Five in the holding.
00:05:23.060 H: And quite a few on your side![Hansen and Derek laugh]
00:05:26.660 H: So, who gets bitten?D: I get bitten.H: You get bitten!
00:05:29.320 H: In reality, we would repeat this experiment, maybe eight times or so.
00:05:33.300 D: Right.H: And switching you guys around, but I think this is a good way to show how this works.
00:05:42.360 D: Okay, so that result was not particularly scientifically rigorous, but it did reproduce our experience in the wild,
00:05:48.700 D: which is that I am much more attractive. ....Well at least when it comes to mosquitoes, than Raquel.
00:05:55.460 D: But the question is, I guess, does this come down to our genetics?
00:05:59.240 R: Yeah, so, we spat into some tubes and sent them off to be tested.D: Right, and we were interested in seven particular
00:06:05.420 D: locations on our DNA, which were located in a 2017 study that involved 23andMe.
00:06:11.200 D: So the way 23andMe works is, when you sign up, you can opt in to be part of research,
00:06:15.920 D: and 16 000 people agreed to be part of this study and rate their perceived attractiveness to mosquitoes.
00:06:21.460 D: So then what the scientists did was a genome-wide association study, that is, they looked at all the DNA
00:06:27.260 D: of all of those participants and tried to see if there were commonalities amongst the people who
00:06:32.600 D: said they were attractive to mosquitoes and that were different to the people who said they weren't attractive to mosquitoes.
00:06:37.920 D: And they identified seven particular locations on the DNA. Seven single letter changes which seemed
00:06:44.280 D: to be associated with different levels of attractiveness to mosquitoes.
00:06:47.840 D: So we have our results back, and do you wanna see them?R: I do. I do, I'm very curious.
00:06:52.620 D: Alright, let's pull it up here.
00:06:54.860 D: Okay, so of the seven locations that are related to mosquito attractiveness, it turns out we have the identical DNA at four of them.
00:07:03.060 D: So you can rule those out.R: Okay.D: Which leaves only three areas where we actually have differing
00:07:08.320 D: DNA. So, at the first location, you have one copy of a letter change which actually makes you significantly
00:07:15.900 D: *protected* from mosquitoes.R: Oh, no way!
00:07:18.660 D: Yeah, it's associated with decreased attractive to mosquitoesR: Oh, that's cool!
00:07:21.450 D: I do not have any letter changes at that location. Now, at the second location where we differ, I have
00:07:29.520 D: a letter change compared to you that makes *me* less attractive to mosquitoes, so more protected.
00:07:36.040 R: Interesting.D: If you look at the significance of those two letter changes,
00:07:39.720 D: yours is about twice as significant than mine.R: Okay.
00:07:43.100 D: But still we both have a protective letter switch. So, in the last snip we actually differ significantly.
00:07:51.120 D: And I have two copies of a variant that makes me more attractive to mosquitoes.
00:07:57.180 D: This was the only snip which was associated with being more attractive to mosquitoes,
00:08:01.520 D: and I have two copies of that change, and you have no copies of that change.
00:08:07.280 R: So that makes sense.D: So overall, I would say our genetics really adds up here.
00:08:12.580 D: And of course, we can't say that this proves that it is right, but it is definitely consistent
00:08:17.640 D: with these snips actually being associated with your attractiveness to mosquitoes, and that's sort of...
00:08:22.600 D: borne out by our experience.R: That's so cool!
00:08:25.220 D: Now, it's unclear exactly how these genetic changes might make us more or less attractive to mosquitoes,
00:08:30.860 but it's likely that it has something to do with the odor or the volatile chemicals
00:08:35.919 that our bodies give off, and due to the microbiome, the bacteria on our skin.
00:08:40.600 One of the main signals that mosquitoes like to follow is carbon dioxide.
00:08:45.040 So that means if you have a higher metabolism, or if you've just been exercising, or if you're a bigger person, or even if you're pregnant,
00:08:51.520 you are more likely to attract mosquitoes. But mosquitoes are also attracted to some other volatiles
00:08:57.540 that we give off, things like lactic acid, acetone and ammonia.
00:09:01.800 But scientists have also found some chemicals that repel, or appear to impair mosquitoes' ability to find us.
00:09:09.460 Those chemicals we naturally give off are octanal, nonanal, decanal, and 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one.
00:09:17.780 So, why is this important?
00:09:19.680 Well the researchers estimate that our attractiveness to mosquitoes is about as hereditary as height
00:09:25.200 or IQ, that is to say genetics play a significant role here, so
00:09:30.100 understanding that relationship is really important, especially when you consider that, of all the animals,
00:09:34.880 mosquitoes have the greatest impact on human health.
00:09:37.520 D: Are mosquitoes the worst animal of all time for humans?H: Absolutely.
00:09:41.240 H: Absolutely, there's no question about that. Malaria has killed more people than people have killed people. They are the most dangerous animal in the world.
00:09:49.580 D: By some estimates, mosquitoes have killed more than half of the humans who have ever lived.
00:09:55.220 Now, that estimate has been debated and is likely too high, but even so, this year, over a million people will die
00:10:02.580 of mosquito-borne illnesses. So if not half, certainly a significant number of humans have died
00:10:08.560 due to mosquitoes, probably more than any other single cause, which led me to wonder:
00:10:13.360 D: Do you think humans may have evolved this trait to smell worse to mosquitoes as an adaptation to avoid the diseases? Or...
00:10:20.820 D: is it just by accident that some people are less attractive to mosquitoes than others?
00:10:25.780 H: .......
00:10:27.560 H: ...That is a really good question![both laugh]
00:10:30.960 D: And while we're on the subject of evolution, consider this:
00:10:34.100 if you ever contract malaria, it actually changes your body chemistry
00:10:39.580 to make you produce an odor that makes you more attractive to mosquitoes.
00:10:44.300 Think about that! The malaria parasite has evolved so that, when it's in its host,
00:10:50.160 it makes the host more attractive to mosquitoes... mosquitoes are the thing that transmit malaria!
00:10:56.620 It's phenomenal! I mean evolution is incredible!

00:11:10.380 humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes, and the point of the company is to help people
00:11:14.480 understand what's written in your chromosomes. Now, at the minute, you can't get access to
00:11:19.200 the mosquito attractiveness test, but maybe, one day in the future, you will be able to.
00:11:23.580 Right now, you can access tons of information about your physical traits, about aspects of your health,
00:11:28.700 and about where you DNA and, I guess, you come from. So I thought I would share my results with you.
00:11:34.360 I come from all over the world as you can see from the map, but significantly more from Europe, about 95% European.
00:11:40.720 You can drill down into that and see that I'm largely British and Irish, and French and German, with a bit of Scandinavian.
00:11:46.620 What's interesting to me is, there's a 3.3% South Asian which is something I think my family suspected,
00:11:53.820 but didn't know for sure, so it's interesting the types of information you can find out which is stored in your DNA.
00:11:59.080 So, if you wanna find out about the information in your DNA, you can go to 23andme.com/veritasium.
00:12:04.880 So I want to thank 23andMe for supporting Veritasium, and I want to thank you for watching.
